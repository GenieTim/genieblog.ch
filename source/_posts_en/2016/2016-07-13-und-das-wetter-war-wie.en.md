I pay attention to appropriate alliterations at the beginning of a somewhat limited-excellent entry.

But let's talk about the weather.
On the day of my arrival I was soaked to the bone after covering a distance of almost 200 meters. Because of the rain. On the second day I was just as quickly soaked. This time, however, with a cloudless sky and the most beautiful sunshine. Since then, the third week in particular has been rainy again, the other days were characterized by a pleasantly warm temperature, but high humidity, which drove sweat out of your pores. The reason for the high air humidity is surely the many ponds, lakes, streams and rivers that characterize the landscape in and around Moscow. The tractors that periodically cool the streets with water may also contribute to this. There was no day when clouds were not visible anywhere in the sky. On the other hand, even with the greatest flash floods, there was a bruise somewhere in the sky.

The rainy times were associated with thunderstorms. And if it gets going, then it's right. According to my information, 3 people in Moscow died as a result of lightning strikes on Sunday 3 July and others were injured. The use of an electronic device was fatal for all of them. But what I want to say is that the weather has taken on forms that I am not used to from Switzerland. This is also related to the geographical location: far and wide no mountains that could affect the wind or the clouds in any way. If the wind comes from the north, it gets cold, it comes warm from the south.
