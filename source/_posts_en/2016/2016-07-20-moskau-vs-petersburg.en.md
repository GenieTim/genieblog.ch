A continuously updated article with the differences that I noticed in these two big cities.

**The subway**
After my train journey from Moscow to St. Petersburg, I had to take the metro and luggage.
I was surprised a lot because there was simply no such thing in Moscow.
For example, advertising: Moscow's metro looks thoroughly clean and pure.
There is no rubbish lying around, the elegant arches and supports look polished, and advertising is nowhere to be seen.
It is quite different in St. Petersburg: the corridors are lit up practically only by neon signs.
There is no impression of noble stations like I had in Moscow.
Furthermore, at some stations here in St. Petersburg, the tracks are separated from the platform by doors that open automatically when the train stops.
Such precision on the part of the lure leaders was not necessary in Moscow.

**The language**
A huge country, a language: Russian.
But like in so many other countries, there seem to be dialects in Russia.
In the case of Moscow and St. Petersburg, it is the letter Ñ‡ which, in a certain context, is pronounced "sh" in Moscow, while in St. Petersburg it retains the actual pronunciation "ch". There are probably some other differences, but at least I noticed this too.
