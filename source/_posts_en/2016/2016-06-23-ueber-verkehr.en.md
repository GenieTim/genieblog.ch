Fortunately, the term "traffic" is widespread. So my first encounter with traffic was at the airport. With a delay of just over 30 minutes, my plane landed comfortably and gently at Moscow airport. Instead of docking onto the terminal hose 10 meters next door, all passengers had to leave the aircraft through the tailgate. Two transport buses were waiting in two different directions to take us to passport control and connecting flights. Why the two buses stood in different directions and which one should be boarded is still unclear to me. In any case, the bus I chose took me after a detour that led around in a wide circle to passport control as it should be.

After the passport control, my contact person for the organization in Moscow was waiting for me. She led me to her car, which took us to my dormitory at half an hour from Moscow. We spent most of the time on the large, five- to six-lane highways that encircle Moscow like a belt. Traffic rules seemed unnecessary to me on these streets, there was so much free space. And apparently I was not alone with this opinion: most drivers seemed to drive as they liked. And the motorcyclists first: with or without a passenger, their speed seemed record-breaking, their curves tighter than in the ski slalom. But there was enough space.

Now I arrived safely in my new, temporary home. During the night I experienced another traffic encounter. Or rather, with its noises. Unfortunately, the dormitory is located on another four-lane road. And because of the temperatures, it is simply not possible to go to sleep with the windows closed.

The next day I spent mostly wandering around looking for a metro station. According to a safe source, there is only a pre-paid public transport ticket in the metro stations. I didn't have my travel guide with me any more than I had a street map on my cell phone. After a while I followed the glorious idea of ​​taking a look at the maps at the various bus stations where I walked twice and three times. Although this idea led me in the wrong direction first because of poor card reading skills, I managed to find the metro station. This offered me the most difficult task so far: buying the correct ticket. It is doubtful whether the campaign was successful.

The time as a pedestrian brought me yet another insight: thanks to the wide streets you can stop at any point while crossing and the cars can bypass you;)
In any case, Theoretsch. In practice, thanks to a sufficient number of pedestrian strips, it is not necessary at all. The traffic lights on the pedestrian strips offer a very practical feature from my point of view: They show the seconds it takes until the traffic lights turn red or green again. So you can make a competent decision whether you can still take the plunge or not. The green light consists of an animated green man who runs faster when time is running out. And especially in these modern times, the time displayed has the responsibility to tell the pedestrian looking at his cell phone how long he can concentrate on the essentials, his smartphone.
