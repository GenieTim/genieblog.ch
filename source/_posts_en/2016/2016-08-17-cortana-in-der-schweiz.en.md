With the Anniversary Update of Windows 10, the time has finally come - the voice assistant from Microsoft is finally also available in Switzerland.
Cortana only understands High German, but that is understandable.
To activate Cortana, you first need the latest update from Windows.
This is meanwhile also available for mobile devices and can be installed in the settings under _Update and Security_ and _Windows Update_.

A small setting is then necessary for activation.
Clicking on the magnifying glass icon opens a window in which you have to click on the gear wheel above the feedback icon in the lower left to open the settings for this search.
There you will find the setting for the language of Cortana.
It is pointed out that the region and language do not correspond to an available Cortana language.
However, you can select the language **German (Germany)** from a list.
Another warning that the region and language do not match Cortana's language and that some features may not be available can be safely clicked away.
And yay - that's it! Cortana is now activated on your device.

I was especially pleased that the pesky **{searchTerms} bug** on my Lumia 930 has finally been solved and disappeared.
With this error, an edge tab with a Google search for {searchTerms} always opened when I touched the magnifying glass icon.
