As is so often the case, the reasons are historical.
This page was originally started in German.
After all, that's my mother tongue.
However, since I mainly use English in my daily work, read blogs and use software in English,
I wanted to give something back and also share my findings in English.
However, since my most read post is still the most clicked one in German,
I didn't want to replace the language so quickly.
From then on, my blog offered both languages, in parallel.
I didn't want the languages to be mixed, together,
meaning having each post in either language, but all of them on the same index,
because that would be inappropriate for the user interface for half of the users.
So I bothered to translate some of the posts.
Fortunately, so far most of my posts notes rather than novels, so that the work is manageable.
Only the migration was not as easy as hoped for, since most
static page generators do not provide this functionality in a very accessible way.
