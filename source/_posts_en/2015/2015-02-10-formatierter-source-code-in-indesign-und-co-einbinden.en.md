Be it a bachelor's, doctoral or just a little schoolwork in the field of computer science: it hardly gets by without code. But how can you integrate the code, as nicely as it is formatted in Eclipse and Co., without _LaTeX_ knowledge in Word or InDesign?

Taking a screenshot is one way. This can be done either with the keyboard shortcuts _cmd + shift + 3_ or _cmd + shift + 4_ on the Mac or on the Windows PC with the following instructions: [http://windows.microsoft.com/de-CH/windows-xp/ help / setup / take-a-screen-shot] (http://windows.microsoft.com/de-CH/windows-xp/help/setup/take-a-screen-shot)

However, this approach is not worthwhile for longer code that breaks the screen. Fortunately, there is at least one other solution: Export the code with _file -> print -> adobe pdf_ or _file -> print -> adobe pdf_ from eclipse or similar to a pdf that you can easily integrate. If the Adobe PDF selection as a printer is not available, you can download the freeware [CutePDF Writer] (http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp) and select it in the print dialog. But be careful if you choose this program that you do not accidentally install the ask-toolbar.
Depending on the print dialog, it is not even necessary to select Adobe PDF as the printer, and the print dialog offers its own option of exporting the code as a PDF (see following screenshot).
