With Windows (Phone) 8, Microsoft gave developers the opportunity to develop their apps for Windows & Windows Phone with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
So it is particularly tempting for web developers like me to port the web app to those devices.

Windows Phone in particular shines with great personalizability; In addition to the flexibility of the lock screen, the background image that completes the start screen, the accent color is also an often cited argument, which is why Windows Phone is more customizable.

But how is it possible, if you develop the app with HTML and CSS, to access the accent color? The answer is simple once you have found it: via the color with the name `Highlight`. The right text color can be used with `HighlightText`.
