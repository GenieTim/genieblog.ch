With Windows (Phone) 8, Microsoft gave developers the opportunity to develop their apps for Windows & Windows Phone with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
So it is particularly tempting for web developers like me to port the web app to those devices.

Windows Phone in particular shines with great personalizability; In addition to the flexibility of the lock screen, the background image that completes the start screen, the accent Colour is also an often cited argument, which is why Windows Phone is more customizable.

But how is it possible, if you develop the app with HTML and CSS, to access the accent Colour? The answer is hard to find at the time of this writing, but makes sense once you have found it: via the Colour with the name `Highlight`. The right text Colour can be used with `HighlightText`.
