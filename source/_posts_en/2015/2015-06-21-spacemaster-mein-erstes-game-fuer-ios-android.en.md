The game, which I originally developed as a project in EF Informatik, is now available for Android and iOs.

The game is all about flying your rocket through space and collecting the gold coins you will find along the way.
But be careful: the universe is full of dangerous meteorites and enemy ufos that steal your coins and want to destroy you! Dodge them to crack the high score.

The game is very simple and reminds a little of Flappy Bird, mainly because of the difficulty level.
Even if high high scores on the first few attempts seem impossible, the game is highly recommended for one or the other occasion! The high scores on iOs are exchanged with the GameCenter and on Android with Swarm.

Unfortunately, offering apps in the iTunes Store is not free, so I cannot offer the game for free.
However, the price of CHF 1.- is comparatively very low, so hopefully these costs won't prevent you from downloading the app.

How many points did you get?
