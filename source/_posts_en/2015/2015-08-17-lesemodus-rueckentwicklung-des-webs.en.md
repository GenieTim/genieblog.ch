More and more devices with Internet access are offering the option in the browser to simply display the website as text with the pictures without style.
Depending on the browser, this function is called "Reader View" or "Read mode", for example.
The amazing thing about this is that, according to my observations, it means a step backwards on the path of web development.
In reading mode, as at the very beginning of the Internet, the pages are only displayed with the most basic HTML tags: only the different headings, links and paragraphs are used.
This mode actually makes reading much easier and therefore offers a lot of potential.
However, I still see some weaknesses.
On the one hand, the web pages are still fully loaded and therefore consume just as much internet performance.
On the other hand, the style of the reading mode does not correspond to the standard style of the browser for some unknown reason - so if a developer thinks he can make it easy and simply leave the style out because his page just has to be read, he was unfortunately wrong.
The standard layout is still full 90s and it is not to be expected that the user will switch on the Reader View.
Instead, he goes to another website he likes better ...

Have you looked at this article in reading mode? Is my opinion too far-fetched for you? Write your answer in the comments!
