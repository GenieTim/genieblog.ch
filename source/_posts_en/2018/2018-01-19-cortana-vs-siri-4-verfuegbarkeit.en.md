It took a long time, but now this point also seems to go to Cortana: For not too long, Cortana has been available on Windows 10 devices as standard in Switzerland without having to be tricky, and Siri is also available on desktop devices and laptops equipped with the latest MacOS. But there is the wharen point, because Cortana in particular will soon also be available on iOS and Android devices, which, conversely, can never be said by Siri.
