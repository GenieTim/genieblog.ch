Well, at least I would like this kind of controversy/conspiracy as it would lead to the opposite effect of what the vaccination-conspiracy is leading to today. Also, this theory would be a lot more supportable by evidence, numbers and logic than the dangerous conspiracy which is spread today. 

I sincerly hope that one day, people can relax a bit more over their opinions, find a common midway, depending on the issue, and stop braging with unconventional, illogical and inconsequent ideas.
