My name is Tim Bernhard, I was born on 2 August 1996.
I attended the Cantonal School in Wiedikon and graduated in spring 2015. As a high school graduate I have connected my passion for programming projects with hopes for the future and founded the company [_Bernhard Webstudio_](http://bernhard-webstudio.ch).

Since then, I finished a Bachelor in Chemical Engineering at ETH Zurich 
and am currently pursuing further degrees in Computational Science 
and Engineering at ETH Zurich too.

Do not hesitate to contact me, in case of questions, job opportunities 
or just some funny thing you found on the internet:
